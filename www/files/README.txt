Folder for external files to be referenced by the queries.
The name of the folder is the name of the schema.
It is independent from the database name.
In queries.xml, the file names are in elements <ahrefs> and <images> where 
the exact column name with file name is in <dbcolumnname>.

Example:

dbdipview/www/files/registerX/picture1.png
